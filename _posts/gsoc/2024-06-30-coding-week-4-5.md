# Week 4 & 5 progess (June 17 - June 30)

These two weeks were crucial for the project as the mid-term evaluation approached, and we needed to cover most of the work. We held a special meeting in addition to our weekly status call, where my mentors and I discussed the project in a more detailed and thorough manner.

After receiving valuable feedback from my mentors on my PR, I began working on resolving the issues.

## Weekly Status Call (17th June)
### Discussion
Following the implementation of the Post Scan Plugin, the agenda of this meeting focused on incorporating the `license_clarity_score` attribute into the codebase scan for each individual package.

Implemented this with changes in the `package_plugin` side.
1. Firstly moved the `--package-summary` post scan plugin from `summarycode/package_summary.py` in the `packagedcode/package_plugin.py` where the main scan_plugins like `package`, `system-package`, `package-only` were there as normal scan options.
- Changes in `setup.cfg`
    ```python
    scancode_post_scan =
        package_summary = packagedcode.plugin_package:PackageSummary
        summary = summarycode.summarizer:ScanSummary
        tallies = summarycode.tallies:Tallies
        tallies-with-details = summarycode.tallies:TalliesWithDetails
    ```
- Changes in `plugin_package.py`
    ```python
        from commoncode.cliutils import SCAN_GROUP, POST_SCAN_GROUP
        from plugincode.post_scan import post_scan_impl
        from plugincode.post_scan import PostScanPlugin
        ---------Previous-imports------------------------------------------
        @post_scan_impl
        class PackageSummary(PostScanPlugin):
            """
            Summary at the Package Level.
            """
        options = [
            PluggableCommandLineOption(('--package-summary',),
            is_flag=True, default=False,
            help='Generate Package Level summary',
            help_group=POST_SCAN_GROUP)
        ]
        def is_enabled(self, package_summary, **kwargs):
        return package_summary

        def process_codebase(self, codebase, package_summary, **kwargs):
        """
        Process the codebase.
        """
        if not self.is_enabled(package_summary):
            return
    ```

2. Also renaming the attribute name from `license_clarity` to `license_clarity_score`.
3. Regenerating tests in accordance with the changes ensures the code remains consistent and everything runs smoothly.

## GSoC Sync Call (21st June)
### Discussion
This was a special call arranged by my mentors to gain more clarity on the progress and how the project should meet its milestones.

Additionally, we discussed how the `license_clarity_score` field would be included in the Package instance following the use of the postscan plugin.

1. Major implentation in the `PackageScanner` (Class that Scans a Resource for Package data and report these as "package_data" at the file level. Then create "packages" from these "package_data" at the top level.)

    - In the process codebase method of this class, there was need to include the package_summary flag as input so to have check if `package-summary` plugin is enabled or not.
    ```python
    def process_codebase(self, codebase, strip_root=False, package_only=False, package_summary=False, **kwargs):
            """
            Populate the ``codebase`` top level ``packages`` and ``dependencies``
            with package and dependency instances, assembling parsed package data
            from one or more datafiles as needed.

            Also perform additional package license detection that depends on either
            file license detection or the package detections.
            """
            # If we only want purls, we want to skip both the package
            # assembly and the extra package license detection steps
            if package_only:
                return

            has_licenses = hasattr(codebase.root, 'license_detections')

            # These steps add proper license detections to package_data and hence
            # this is performed before top level packages creation
            for resource in codebase.walk(topdown=False):
                # populate `from_file` attribute in matches
                for package_data in resource.package_data:
                    for detection in package_data['license_detections']:
                        populate_matches_with_path(
                            matches=detection['matches'],
                            path=resource.path,
                        )

                    for detection in package_data['other_license_detections']:
                        populate_matches_with_path(
                            matches=detection['matches'],
                            path=resource.path,
                        )
    ```

2. Passing the `package_summary` flag to the `create_package_and_deps` func that creates and save top-level Package and Dependency from the parsed package data present in the codebase.
    ```python
        # Create codebase-level packages and dependencies
        create_package_and_deps(codebase, package_summary, strip_root=strip_root, **kwargs)
        #raise Exception()
    ```
3. Updates in the `create_package_and_deps` func to have the `license_clarity_score` in the package attribute when plugin was used.
    ```python
    def create_package_and_deps(codebase, package_summary= False ,package_adder=add_to_package, strip_root=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Create and save top-level Package and Dependency from the parsed
    package data present in the codebase.
    """
    packages, dependencies = get_package_and_deps(
        codebase,
        package_adder=package_adder,
        strip_root=strip_root,
        **kwargs
    )
    codebase.attributes.packages.extend(
        package.to_dict(package_summary= package_summary)
        for package in packages
    )
    codebase.attributes.dependencies.extend(dep.to_dict() for dep in dependencies)
    ```
4. To make sure the Package Model had this attribute, updates in `models.py`
    - With the default value as False for the `package_summary`, the `to_dict` method returns the package details with `license_clarity_score` when only the plugin was used.
    ```python
    def to_dict(self, package_summary= False):
        data = super().to_dict(with_details=False)
        if not package_summary:
            data.pop("license_clarity_score")
        return data
    ```

## Weekly Status Call (24th June)
### Discussion
Major point that was dicussed in this meet, was to include the major changes that was there in scancode-toolkit [develop branch](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/tree/develop) to my [Pull Request](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3792)

Some of the tests were failing after those commits and needed to be regenerated. I regenerated the tests and reviewed the `git diff` to ensure that only the changes related to the PR and commit were included.

![test-regeneration](/assets/images/test-regeneration.webp)

Also recived a suggestion to have the license_clarity_score to be stored as `dict` and not `list`

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/assets/images/lcs_as_list.webp" width="350" />
    <span> </span>
  <img src="/assets/images/lcs_as_dict.webp" width="350" /> 
</div>

Also this week, we had a small test addition in the `test_plugin_package`-
```python
    # just for test purpose, used change-case example
    def test_plugin_package_with_package_summary(self):
        test_dir = self.get_test_loc('package_summary/change-case-change-case-5.4.4.zip-extract') 
        result_file = self.get_temp_file('json')
        expected_file = self.get_test_loc('package_summary/expected.json')

        run_scan_click(['--package', '--strip-root', '--processes', '-2','--package-summary','--json-pp', result_file, test_dir])
        check_json_scan(expected_file, result_file, remove_uuid=True, remove_file_date=True, regen=REGEN_TEST_FIXTURES)
```

With the dir structure as follows-
```shell
.
└── change-case-change-case-5.4.4
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── SECURITY.md
    ├── package-lock.json

    │       ├── package.json
    │       ├── src
    │       └── tsconfig.json
    └── tsconfig.base.json
```
This type of example was chosen because it contains 4 packages, making it easy to run tests and providing more comprehensive information.
